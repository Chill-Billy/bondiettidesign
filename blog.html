      There are tales from times past that tell of a giant demi-god who roamed the 
      rocky mountains north of what is now called Yellowstone. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
     The creature's height equaled that of a coastal cedar.
     Its apparance was that of a large, beaked grizzly bear whose fur turned to feathers and back again
     before your very eyes. Its feet were not bear paws, but rooster's claws with a massive razor sharp barb at each heel. It strummed a magical lute which it used to control the weather. When you heard the thundering in the mountiains, you knew the 
     great Rooster-Bear was calling forth the rains.
   </p>
   <br>
    <p>
    What most folks don't know, was that the melodies and cadence were one and the same of an 
    American singer called John Denver. In fact, if you listen closely, you can almost hear the 
    plucked guitar patterns of 'Sunshine On My Shoulders' in the pitter-patter of the last rain 
    drops of an afternoon storm in the Rocky Mountains. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      "Meow"
    </h3>
    <br>
     <p>
      The meow isn't the sound of the average house-cat. It echoes and reverberates through the air, 
      hovering above the fields of wheat. It makes you want to hug your loved ones and pounce on spiders. 
      You know this call. It is the season of the harvest and you know that 
      you must drop all plans and commence the harvest immediately.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In one region of the lands of the northern plains, a poor, kind wheat-farmer took in a small 
      kitten who had lost her mother. They did not know this kitten was actually the trickster-god,
      Meg ~ the god of bountiful harvests.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Years ago, Meg grew bored of taking care of the people of the lands, and so took for herself two decades 
      out of her rule of the catdom to see what it was like to be taken care of. She took a 
      kitten's form and decided to test the loyalty of one man named 
      Billbro Braggins. Billbro took Meg in, of course, and he proved to be a loyal companion. He scritched her behind the ears 
      and under the chin exactly the way she liked and baked up many fine treats that rivaled the taste of fresh killed field-mouse.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Meg lived a full and happy cat's life, having had many litters of kittens and spending her days 
      hunting small creatures among the wheat and barley fields and snatching butterflies from her roof-top perch.
      She decided to move back to the spirit lands, but as a reward for a life well lived, she crept 
      into her servant-master's dreams and thanked him for his service. She left her friend with 
      the following words:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>"Billbro, I must move on! I am leaving you with a blessing and a call to action whenever you hear my voice on the winds. 
      This is the day you must harvest the fields. Do exactly as I say and your family will be blessed."
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Meg was gone in the morning. Farmer Billbro knew this was no ordinary dream, and so made his mind up to follow her orders. 
      Years later, one September, Billbro heard Meg's 
      call. It echoed like a thunder-clap, but was very distinctly a 'meow'. He at once called to his
      community and told them of his dream. The elders of the community were planning to wait another
      two weeks to let some of the greener fields turn gold, but Billbro took note of the cloud 
      formations and implored the elders to heed Meg's call.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The elders of the village discussed the facts amonst themselves for the morning. They remembered the 
      farm cat's magnificently lustrous fur and her otherworldly, glowing, green and gold eyes.
      Sometimes these eyes betrayed a god's intelligence. They finally assesed Billbro's past deeds, and 
      since he had lived a life of honor and kindness, the elders saw no reason not to deem him a 
      worthy and true-prophet, and after all, had they also not heard the clear sound of a cat's meow
      echoing across the hilltops?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>All of the fields were harvested, dried and gleaned two weeks early. The tribe had lost a small portion of its crops to the early harvest. 
      Just when the elders were beginning to question their sanity, and the neighbor villages 
      fields were looking more glorious than any previous years, a 100 year storm blew in. 
      It rained, and rained, and rained for three months. The rain storms lasted so long, 
      they formed new lakes and carved new river beds, Many low-land villages were swallowed up 
      in floods.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      When the other villages were dashing to save their fields, the Braggins tribe was protecting
      their food-stores and digging canals around thier village. The storm became like a monsoon season
      that lasted through winter, and the rain turned to sleet and then to snow. The tribe dug in for
      a long winter and were saved through to spring by their early harvest. Most other tribes in the region 
      were no more. The Braggins tribe re-populated the lands and told the legend of Meg for centuries.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To this day, all high plains children are taught to be extra super kind to cats, and the region is known
      for its bountiful harvests.

      <i>This photo was composed by asking MidJourney AI to imagine the following:
      <b>"A tidal wave in front of a pacific northwest mountain range done in the 
        style of The Great Wave of Kanagawa."</b></i>
    </p>
    <br><hr><br>

    <p><i>As told to us by our glorioius founder, Tim Tebow the fifth, Hero of District 11.</i></p>
    <br>
      <p> Many remember the tidal-wave of epic proportions that took out the whole west coast.
      It was a human generated phenomenon. No one expected Elon Musk to take on Mister Beast's
      billionaire challenge to create the world's most epic bass drop by constructing a massive island 
      out of the pacific garbage patch from where they could throw the worlds most epic parties, 
      but once Grimes signed on to come back home if he completed the project, Elon was in.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>There were plenty of starving scientists desperate to attach themselves to Elon's name for
      status. Capable technicians were working for pennies on the dollar for the chance to
      rave with cute twenty something party girls all alone on an island at sea.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>After a quick discussion, and a huff of Modafanil through the right nostril with a Ketamine
      chaser through the right, Musk & co. decided to spray plastic melting chemicals on top of 
      the garbage patch, while at the same time, racing the mega-yachts of all the richest men in
      the world around the garbage patch in a huge swarm at top speed, with the slowest boat having
       one babe removed from his boat for each time lapped by a competitor, (Mark Cuban ended up with 
       no babes. Gates led with a billionaire-best +7 babes), creating a whirlpool effect capable of keeping the 
       blob of plastic goo together long enough to congeal and solidify
      into the perfect shape of a speaker cone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    At the world's first garbage-people ocean party, every desire was filled, and a good time was had
    by all. Upon approval from Elon's finest technicians, Grimes, like, DROPPPED that fucking beat. 
    She walked right up to that big square button on her iPad and she PUSSSHED it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>At 11:59 on Tuesday, December 31 of 2024, the worlds sickest bass drop, on the worlds largest
      speaker, made from the Pacific garbage patch, created the world's largest tidal wave. Hundreds of 
      millions of people were killed on both sides of the ocean.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Upon hearing that the weebs of the west coast and the godless socialists of China were wiped 
    clean off of the face of the earth, clean-living, god-fearing humanity rejoiced!
    Libertarian gamers called each other cancellable names over voice chat in DOTA2 in celebration of 
    Elon Musks freedom to do whatever the fuck he wants, whenever the fuck he wants, however the fuck he wants.
     All of the libertarian gamer's evangelical christian mothers were sure Elon must be the second 
    coming of Jesus Christ himself to have been able to wipe all the 
    sinners of the west-coast off the earth in one fell swoop.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      An ancient-but-triumphant Mitch McConnell led the United Christian States in a coup that changed the course of
      history and gave us all the freedoms that we hold dear today. AOC retired from politics, went 
      Challenger as a one-trick-pony Lux support on the Brazil regional server of League of Legends.
      Once the perpetual chatter of the west-coast liberals went silent, mankind grew towards greater harmony.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      For this reason we, the survivors of the apocalypse, called Armageddon in the bible book of
      Revelations, celebrate our lord and savior's return to earth, with these simple words:
     <br><br>
      <i>God Bless Elon.<br>
      God Bless Grimes.<br>
      God Bless Mitch.<br>
      Hillary commits crimes.<br>
      AMEN!
      </i>
