        Thank you for stopping by!
        I have had eight years of experience in the newspaper business, 
        which has contributed to a very broad based media skillset including:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Photography</b></li>
        <li><b>Traditional Darkroom</b></li>
        <li><b>1990s Design Programs</b> ~ <i>My first program was Aldus Pagemaker. Figma reminds me of it.</i></li>
        <li><b>Adobe Suite</b> ~ <i>I converted my newspaper from traditional to digital methods in the late 1990s, early 2000s.</i></li>
        <li><b>Ad Design</b> ~ <i>I was our newspaper's primary ad designer. We used Quark Xpress back then. I sampled InDesign but it wasn't ready yet.</i></li>
        <li><b>Traditional Media Design</b> ~ <i>Our newspaper was also a printshop. I designed business stationary, calendars and Campaign Posters for our clients and was the primary contact.</i></li>
        <li><b>Auxilliary Writing Skills</b> ~ <i>We had an excellent editor at our newspaper and I was encoouraged to
            write the occasional article. I used to contact Ski Lodges in Montana and trade out advertising space for lodging and lift tickets.</i>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the early 2000's I was also a jack-of-all-trades digitally when I ran my own 
       small business. I maintained my website with WordPress including designing a small 
       'do your own estimate' form. I ran my own business, purchased ads in local media outlets and 
       engaged in business estimates and sales. I did my own invoicing and bookkeeping
       and managed employees. Notable programs I have used during these times are:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <b>
        <li>WordPress</li>
        <li>Squarespace</li>
        <li>GoogleMyBusiness and Maps</li>
        <li>Quickbooks Desktop and Online</li>
        <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
        <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
        </b>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The following are the things I have worked on to level up my programming skills.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <b>
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Adobe Suite Refresher course</li>
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>in progress ~ bootstrap</li>
        <li>in progress ~ javascript</li>
        <li>not too distant future ~ completion of UX/UI course by Google.</li>
        </b>
    </ul>
